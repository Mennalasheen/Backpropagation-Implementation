Task Objective: Implemented the Back-Propagation learning algorithm on a multi-layer neural network for classification tasks.
	Preprocessing: Replacing null values with median /Apply feature scaling/Data encoding: using one-hot encoder
	Algorithms: Back-propagation that is used to train the neural network by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases based on the difference between predicted and actual outputs.

	Tkinter GUI is used to create user-friendly interface for users to input parameters and run machine learning.
